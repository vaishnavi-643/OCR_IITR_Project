# OCR and Document Search Web Application Prototype 

This project is a web-based application designed to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on uploaded images that contain text in both Hindi and English. The extracted text can then be searched using a keyword search feature, with matching sections highlighted. This application is built using Python, EasyOCR, Streamlit, and other supporting libraries.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images in various formats such as JPG, PNG, or JPEG.
- **OCR Functionality**: Text is extracted from the uploaded image using EasyOCR, which supports both Hindi and English text.
- **Keyword Search**: Users can input keywords to search within the extracted text, and the application highlights matching sections.
- **Preprocessing**: The image is preprocessed (converted to grayscale, thresholded) to improve OCR accuracy.
- **Live Deployment**: The application is deployed online for easy access via a live URL.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
   EasyOCR for OCR functionality.
   Streamlit for building the web interface.
   OpenCV for image preprocessing.
   PIL (Pillow) for image handling.
   NumPy for image manipulation.
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Sharing or any other online platform like Huggingface Spaces.

## Project Structure
- **app.py**: The main file containing the code for the Streamlit app and the OCR processing.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of all required Python libraries to run the application.
- **temp_image.jpg**: Temporary image file generated during OCR processing.
- **README.md**: Documentation explaining the project setup, usage, and deployment.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running:

1.**Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
       git clone <https://github.com/vaishnavi-643/OCR_IITR_Project.git>
  ```

2.**Create and Activate Virtual Environment**:
   ```sh
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # For MacOS/Linux
     venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
  ```

3.**Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4.**Run the Application**:
   ```sh
     streamlit run app.py
   ```
This will launch the application in your browser, where you can upload images and test the OCR functionality.

5.**Testing**: Upload an image containing both Hindi and English text to test the OCR and search functionality. Input a keyword to search within the extracted text, and the matching sections will be highlighted.

## Usage

Once the servers are running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:8501/`.

## Example
Here‚Äôs an example of how the application works:

- User uploads an image containing text in both Hindi and English.
- The OCR processes the image, extracts the text, and displays it on the page.
- User enters a keyword (e.g., ‚Äúsearch‚Äù) in the search box.
- If the keyword is found, the matching section is highlighted.
